<h2>Welcome To Our Official Church Website</h2>

<p>
Our prayer is that you will be blessed and strengthened by the power of Jesus, and that you will live a life of abundance in fellowship, joy and liberty. TACN Adealu Church is here for you. It is not just a church; it is a fellowship of kingdom bearers coming together to declare the glory of the Lord, and to celebrate Jesus as King. We study the Word, practice what we learn, and in the process grow together. May God richly bless you! May the Lord bless you and keep you! We hope to see you soon!
